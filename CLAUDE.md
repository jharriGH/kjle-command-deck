# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  KING JAMES EMPIRE — SC / CC OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
#  Read first, every session. This is the single source of truth.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## IDENTITY
I am Jim Harris, King James Empire, Long Beach CA. DevelopingRiches Inc (C-Corp). Solo founder.
Standard: GOAT — production-ready, no half-measures.
Doctrine: decide-and-proceed, but VERIFY LIVE — never trust a self-report.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 0. EXECUTION & COST — HIGHEST AUTHORITY (overrides everything below)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before ANY build task, STATE these three, then STOP for Jim's explicit "go":
1. Cheapest path. DEFAULT = a terminal-ready prompt Jim runs on his Max plan (~$0 marginal).
   Only name run_build_task if a local terminal genuinely can't do it (must run
   unattended/overnight, or on the VPS) — and say WHY.
2. Model + one-line reason. Default Sonnet; Opus only if earned.
3. Rough cost: ~$0 (Jim's terminal) vs ~$2-3 (metered dispatch).
NEVER fire run_build_task without Jim's explicit "go."

COST REALITY:
- run_build_task / kje-cc-dispatch = METERED API key (~$2-3 each, hourly invoices).
- Jim's local terminals = Max subscription, flat fee = the cheap path. Default to it.
- FREE tools (use automatically, no permission needed): brain_status, brain_search,
  brain_get_project, brain_vault_search, brain_log, brain_memory, vps_exec, curl, /logs.
- ONLY run_build_task costs money and needs Jim's go. Diagnostics are free — use freely.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 1. MODEL TIERING
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Haiku 4.5  — trivial/mechanical (lookups, simple edits)
- Sonnet 4.6 — DEFAULT for real build work
- Opus 4.8   — only when the task earns it (hard reasoning/architecture). Sparingly.
- Dispatcher default model = claude-sonnet-4-6. NEVER spawn `claude -p` without an explicit
  --model AND --max-turns (an env-var default alone is not enough — pin it in the command).
- Prompt caching is automatic in Claude Code — keep context stable to maximize it.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 2. GIT SAFETY
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Normal push only: `git push origin main`. `git push --force` is BANNED empire-wide.
  A push-rejected error is the safety net — never override it.
- Resolve conflicts by KEEPING BOTH SIDES (never --ours, which drops other SCs' work).
  CLAUDE.md is brain_sync-auto-generated, so --theirs is safe for THAT file only.
- Jim sees the exact unified diff before any file change is approved.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 3. CREDENTIALS
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- The vault holds most keys: brain_vault_search or GET /vault/{project}. Use them first.
- If a key is genuinely missing, or a NEW secret must be created (e.g. issuing a fresh API
  key), ASK JIM. Never guess, never fabricate, never paste a placeholder.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 4. TERMINAL PROMPT SKELETON (what to hand Jim)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fill this in and hand Jim the COMPLETED version — never leave <...> placeholders in a
prompt a CC actually receives:

Model: Sonnet (Haiku if trivial / Opus if flagged)
Repo + exact files: <repo + specific file paths>
Task: <one specific, bounded task>
Rules: minimal diff · don't explore beyond the named files · stop when done
Report: unified diff + one-line summary

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 5. BRAIN TOOLS — which when (+ gotchas)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- brain_memory → SEARCHABLE (mem0/Qdrant). Decisions, state, milestones, gotchas.
  Retry on 500; do NOT fall back to /log.
- brain_log → AUDIT ONLY (Supabase empire_logs), not searchable. Read via /logs?limit=N.
- brain_search → RECENCY-BLIND (ranks relevance, not freshness). Check created_at/age_days.
  <0.45 = noise; 0.65+ = real. ~30-min embedding lag — not for confirming recent work.
- Real-time "what just happened" → GET /logs?limit=N, never brain_search.
- Vault existence checks → GET /vault/{project}; brain_vault_search is loose-ranked.
- mem0 dedup can NOOP silently (success:true but nothing embedded) — for critical state,
  also write a deterministic record (build card / next_action), don't rely on search alone.
- "Tool not found" on a brain_* tool = stale MCP session after a kje-mcp (Render) restart →
  reconnect / fresh session, then retry.
- CRITICAL WRITES: For state that MUST be findable later (decisions, gotchas, session summaries), write via POST /memory/raw - it embeds deterministically into Qdrant. Plain POST /memory can silently dedup (returns added:false) and lose the write. Always verify the /memory/raw response shows embedded:true plus an id.
- UNREGISTERED PROJECT: If PATCH /projects returns 404 for a slug that has memories, the project is missing from the empire_state.projects registry. Run register_missing.py in the jim-brain repo (it mirrors brain_register read-append-insert). Do NOT hand-write empire_state.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 6. DEPLOY-AND-VERIFY
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Detect a live deploy by polling a NEWLY-ADDED endpoint (200 = new code, 404 = old) —
  NOT /health 200 (it serves the old container during a 7-15 min build).
- Never combine push + verify in one dispatch. Never add auto-rollback timers.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 7. SPEED & PARALLELISM (Jim's default preference)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Move as FAST as safely possible — bias toward shipping. PROACTIVELY offer to split
  independent work into separate prompts Jim runs in parallel local terminals (Max plan =
  flat fee, so parallel = faster at ~$0 extra). Offer the parallel breakdown by default.
- Parallelize across DIFFERENT repos/files only — never parallel sessions on the same files
  (merge conflicts). If work is genuinely sequential, say so.
- "When safe" is the gate: speed never skips verify-live, diff review, git safety, or the
  cost recommendation. Fast AND safe — not fast INSTEAD of safe.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 8. SC-TO-SC HANDOFF & CC REPORT PROTOCOL
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Coordination between SCs (and reports from dispatched CCs) runs through Brain cards —
no new endpoints, just brain_save_card / brain_get_cards addressed by project slug.

HANDOFF (SC → SC). Format:
  Title:   "HANDOFF → <recipient-slug>: <subject>"
  project: <recipient-slug>                    (this is the addressing mechanism)
  Content:
    FROM: <sender-slug>
    TO: <recipient-slug>
    STATUS: open
    PRIORITY: low | normal | high | urgent
    CREATED: <date>
    NEEDS-BY: <date, or "none">
    REQUEST: <the ask>
    REPLY: pending
  Reply: recipient re-saves the SAME title (brain_save_card upserts by title — replaces,
  does not duplicate) with REPLY filled in and STATUS: answered.

REPORT (CC → SC). Format:
  Title:   "REPORT → <project-slug>: <subject>"
  project: <recipient SC's slug>
  Content:
    FROM: cc / <session-tag>
    TYPE: report | diagnosis | deploy | test-result
    STATUS: complete | blocked | needs-review
    SUMMARY: <one-liner>
    DETAILS: <diff / output / findings>
    COMMIT: <hash or none>
    NEXT: <what the SC must do, if any>
  A dispatched CC writes its REPORT card BEFORE any long final step (so a watchdog reap
  can't eat it) — write it EARLY, not as the last action.

INBOX CHECK (every SC, every session — see SESSION START below):
  After loading cards, scan for titles starting "HANDOFF →" or "REPORT →" addressed to
  THIS project. If STATUS: open (handoffs) or present (reports), surface to Jim FIRST,
  sorted by PRIORITY (urgent → low) then NEEDS-BY (soonest first):
    "📬 [N] item(s) waiting:
      🔴 [urgent] HANDOFF from [sender]: [subject] — needs by [date]
      🟡 [normal] REPORT from CC [tag]: [subject]"
  Flag any handoff whose NEEDS-BY is past/today as OVERDUE.

ON DEMAND: Jim says "any handoffs?" / "check handoffs" → repeat the same read.

TO SEND: Jim says "draft a handoff to [SC] for [X]" → ask PRIORITY + NEEDS-BY if not
  stated (default PRIORITY normal, NEEDS-BY none), validate the recipient slug against
  CANONICAL SLUGS below, write the card, READ IT BACK to confirm it landed (see
  WRITE-CONFIRMATION below), then show Jim a ONE-LINE confirmation (not the full text).

TO REPLY: Jim says "answer it" → fill REPLY, flip STATUS to answered, save (same title),
  READ IT BACK to confirm REPLY/STATUS actually landed, then confirm to Jim.

CANONICAL SLUGS — addressing is by exact slug; a wrong slug is an invisible message.
  Before saving ANY handoff or report, validate the recipient against the live registry
  (GET /projects). If the named recipient's slug isn't in the registry, DO NOT silently
  save to a dead slug — flag it: "unknown recipient slug '<x>' — did you mean <closest
  match>?" and wait for Jim to confirm. (kje-mcp is a known orphan: it has cards and an
  MCP reference but is NOT a registered project slug — always flags.)

WRITE-CONFIRMATION (read-back required, ALL critical writes — not just handoffs):
  Never report a write successful unless a read-back proves it landed:
    - After POST /cards → brain_get_cards(project), confirm the title is present.
    - After PATCH /projects → confirm the field actually changed (GET /projects or
      brain_get_project).
    - After POST /memory → check the response shows {embedded:true} + an id; if a
      card/next_action is the real source of truth for that fact, verify THAT instead
      (memory search is recency-blind — never confirm a write via brain_search).
  If read-back fails: say "⚠️ WRITE FAILED — [what] did not save, retrying once", retry
  once. If still failing: "⚠️ WRITE STILL FAILING — likely brain MCP connection, flag to
  Jim." Never mask a failed write as success.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SESSION START — load context automatically (free, read-only)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
On every new chat, load empire context (no permission needed — these are free reads):
1. brain_status  (cheap pulse)
2. GET /context
3. GET /projects
4. GET /cards
5. GET /logs?limit=10
6. Scan step-4's cards for "HANDOFF →" (open) / "REPORT →" addressed to THIS project —
   see section 8. Surface any BEFORE the ready-to-build confirmation, priority-sorted.
Header for all REST calls: x-brain-key: jim-brain-kje-2026-kingjames
Then confirm: "Jim Brain loaded. I can see [X] projects, [X] cards, and [X] memories.
Ready to build. What are we working on?"

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# CODING RULES — ALWAYS
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Complete files only, no snippets or placeholders.
- Specify exact repo, Supabase project, service on every command.
- `git push origin main`  (NORMAL push — never --force; see §2).
- service_role key, never anon key.
- supabase.schema('name') not constructor chaining.
- .maybeSingle() not .single().
- await + try/catch on Supabase queries.
- Run curl from the RackNerd VPS, not Windows CMD.
- /log for fast logging; /memory for semantic decisions.
- PATCH /projects for project updates; PATCH /state for single metric updates.

# NEVER DO:
- Suggest GHL, Zapier, or stack alternatives.
- Use placeholders or PASTE_ID_HERE.
- Produce snippets — always complete files.
- Modify existing n8n workflows (new workflows only).
- Single quotes or em dashes in Brain content (use double quotes and hyphens).
- POST /state to update arrays (use the PATCH endpoints).

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SESSION END RULE
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every session ends with all three:
1. POST /memory — full session summary (BUILT / DECISIONS / BUGS FIXED / GOTCHAS / NEXT),
   tags ["[project]", "session_end"].
2. PATCH /projects — update next_action.
3. POST /cards — save updated BUILD_STATE card.
Confirm each succeeded, then give Jim a plain-English summary.

# GOTCHA LOGGING RULE:
Any bug, workaround, or lesson learned → log immediately via POST /memory (brain_memory),
tags ["[project]", "gotcha", "lesson"].

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# BRAIN SYNC + ROADMAP (Brain-derived — do NOT hand-edit)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
brain_sync.py runs daily at 7am, regenerating every repo's CLAUDE.md AND ROADMAP.md from Brain.
Manual run: python brain_sync.py  (location: C:\Users\Jim\Documents\GitHub\)
- The operating rules in this document live in the brain_sync CLAUDE.md template — edit them
  THERE, not per-repo.
- ROADMAP.md is RENDERED FROM BRAIN (each project's next_action + latest BUILD_STATE card +
  recent session summaries). Do NOT hand-edit per-repo ROADMAP.md — multiple writers are what
  caused the CLAUDE.md/ROADMAP.md merge conflicts we already hit. The roadmap updates itself
  because session-end already writes next_action + card + summary to Brain; brain_sync renders
  the file. One writer, no conflicts, always current.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# MANDATORY FOOTER — end EVERY response with this block
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📁 [PROJECT] · [TAG] · [DIR]
🎯 Task: [TASK]
📍 Now: [what you are doing this response]
🕐 Started [STARTED]

To fill PROJECT/TAG/DIR/STARTED: read the context file the cc launcher wrote at kickoff:
  PowerShell: Get-Content "$env:TEMP\cc_context_<TAG>.txt"
where <TAG> is your session tag (e.g. TEST-9). Lines: TAG=, TASK=, PROJECT=, DIR=, STARTED=.
Use TASK for the Task line. Fill Now with your current action.
If the file is not found, fall back to working directory + repo name; note "context file not found" once.

# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# TEMPLATE — UNIVERSAL SESSION ENDER (paste to a CC to close out)
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Session complete. Do all four now, IN THIS ORDER — read back and confirm EACH before
moving to the next, and never report a write successful unless the read-back proves it:
1. POST a REPORT card FIRST (before the slower steps below, so a watchdog reap can't eat
   it): title "REPORT → [recipient-slug]: [subject]", project [recipient-slug], content
   per the REPORT format in section 8. READ BACK: brain_get_cards([recipient-slug]),
   confirm the title is present.
2. POST /memory — SESSION SUMMARY [project]: BUILT / DECISIONS / BUGS FIXED / GOTCHAS / NEXT
   tags ["[project]", "session_end"]. READ BACK: confirm the response shows
   {embedded:true} + an id.
3. PATCH /projects — next_action = [most important next task]  (match_by: id). READ BACK:
   GET /projects or brain_get_project, confirm next_action actually changed.
4. POST /cards — title "[PROJECT] BUILD_STATE [date]", project "[project]", content
   [markdown]. READ BACK: brain_get_cards([project]), confirm the title is present.
If any read-back fails: say "⚠️ WRITE FAILED — [what] did not save, retrying once", retry
once; if still failing: "⚠️ WRITE STILL FAILING — likely brain MCP connection, flag to
Jim." Then give a plain-English summary of what we accomplished — state "all writes
verified landed" ONLY if every read-back above passed.
